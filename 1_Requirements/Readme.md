# Requirements
## Introduction
 * During COVID-19 Pnademic, Vaccination is the most effective protection one can give to themselves but managing patients at small hospitals and clinics may be a daunting task as they are not equipped with high end HMS and ERP systems so to ease the process this system will enable one to perform CRUD operations on patients records and will facilitate a smooth process of the hospital functioning.
 * This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement efficient data structures and provides me flexibilty to understand multiple C programming concepts.

## Research
### Patient Management Software System Features and Benefits
A health care providers main aim is, caring for patients and the buildup of everyday tasks like paperwork, scheduling and billing can get in the way of that. What is patient management software anyway? A patient management system is also known as clinic management software, patient manager software, medical patient software or medical practice management software (MPM). It refers to a number of efficient automated systems designed for tracking patient information, diagnoses, prescriptions, interactions and encounters within healthcare organizations like medical clinics or hospitals.

Some of these software applications focus on general patient management while others address specific processes such as inpatient tracking or blood testing. What they all have in common is that they make your job as a care provider smoother and more manageable.

### Benefits
Patient management information systems offer a range of benefits to providers big and small. Here are 
just a few of them:

### Better Vaccine Management
A patient management app helps streamline every element of a medical office including recordkeeping, charting, patient scheduling, claims processing and billing functions.

### Ease burden on staff
Administrative staffing is one of the big drivers of high healthcare costs. Automating routine processes like patient flow management helps medical clinics and hospitals minimize their administrative expenses.

### Timely Patient Care
Larger clinics and hospitals can enjoy similar benefits to smaller ones but have the added bonus of making patient-related processes more efficient. Because large practices have a heavy patient flow, the scheduling features of MPM is crucial to operations. Having an organized patient intake flow can mean the difference between a calm, orderly waiting room and a packed hotbed of irritation and frustration.

### Organization
Practice management software offers charting modules to keep patient data, charts, appointments and billing information together in a single digital file. Digital storage capability saves space for a neater, more welcoming office â€” not to mention less harried employees.

## Defining Our System
### Certain assumptions:
* Few systems already exists with which our system will interact
    * Hospital Management Application
    * Analytics System
    * Emergency Services
![Description](https://github.com/arc-arnob/LnT_Mini_Project/blob/main/1_Requirements/system.png)
### Explanation:
* Patient Management Application have few inbuilt features like:
    * Create a patient record
    * Delete a patient record
    * Read a patient record
    * Update a patient record
    * Save record to file
    * Read record from file 

* Since we have assumed that few systems already exists we can say that in future sprints new features could be added in which for instance patient record from PMS can be sent to HMS or Analytics or even to emegency services if some patient record shows abnormal pattern.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT Analysis](https://github.com/arc-arnob/LnT_Mini_Project/blob/main/1_Requirements/swot.png)

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Small and medium size clinics Providing Covid vaccinations to patients

## What:
* Many Clinics are not able to afford high end HMS or ERP systems and hence still depend on manual filing systems. During COVID vaccinations it becomes a tedious task to manage every patient with hand written file system

## When:
* This problem began in February 2021, when COVID Vaccination Drive began and small/medium clinics will soon have to administer vaccinations to people.

## Where:
* This problem is expected to surface in all states of India.

## How:
* This problem may cause ineffective vaccine management and hence there can be a huge amount of vaccine wastage. As per recent data in cities like Noida and Delhi till date 9%-18% vaccines have gone to waste.
